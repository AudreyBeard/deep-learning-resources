# deep-learning-intro
A collaborative collection of resources for learning the theory and practice of deep learning. Started by Audrey Beard, a PhD student of Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY.


## PyTorch
This repo focuses on PyTorch, since that's what we use in the lab. To get
started with PyTorch, check out
[pytorch-intro.md](https://github.com/AudreyBeard/deep-learning-resources/blob/master/pytorch-intro.md)

## Deep Neural Network Development
There are myriad sources for learning about deep learning. Here's a running
list of the best ones we can find.
Some of these are hidden behind paywalls. You should go to the site to help out
the creators, but if you need access and can't get it for some reason, I have
copies of all these resources.

### A Recipe for Training Neural Networks
[This blog post]( https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/) by Andrej
Karpathy of Stanford (and one author of the ImageNet paper) is a great place to
start with if you're just learning or even experienced and stuck.

### Troubleshooting Deep Neural Networks
[This presentation](http://josh-tobin.com/assets/pdf/troubleshooting-deep-neural-networks-01-19.pdf) by Josh Tobin is also a great resource if you're stuck (or before you get stuck!)
