# deep-learning-intro
A collaborative collection of resources for learning the theory and practice of deep learning


## PyTorch
This repo focuses on PyTorch, since that's what we use in the lab. To get
started with PyTorch, check out
[pytorch-intro.md](https://github.com/AudreyBeard/deep-learning-resources/blob/master/pytorch-intro)

## Deep Learning
There are myriad sources for learning about deep learning. Here's a running
list of the best ones we can find:
- [A Recipe for Training Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/)
    - This blog post was written by Andrej Karpathy, an author of the
      [ImageNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0575.pdf) paper and PhD student of
      CS at Stanford

## Important Papers
- [ImageNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0575.pdf)
    - Arguably pivotal in launching the present wave of computer vision research
    - Enormous and ever-growing image dataset
    - Yearly challenges for several tasks
    - Now a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/imagenet-object-localization-challenge)
    - See [image-net.org](http://www.image-net.org/) for more info
